# Discussion: Build internal/shuttle: one LLM agent via a swappable engine

```yaml
task: 'Build internal/shuttle: one LLM agent via a swappable engine'
slug: internal-shuttle
status: discussing
parent: main
```

## Problem

The orchestration spine (`proc → mux → shuttle → review → loom`) is the designed path to
replacing mill/millhouse with Go orchestration. `proc` and `mux` are done; **shuttle is the
next layer and its only dependency (mux) is complete**. Nothing above it (review, loom) can
be built until shuttle exists.

shuttle runs **one LLM agent as an interactive psmux session** and returns its result over
the file contract. Interactive-never-headless is an economic constraint (headless `claude -p`
is losing subscription coverage; see `CLAUDE.md` "Agent execution"), so the run mechanism is:
build a `claude` launch command, hand it to `mux.AddStrand` as an opaque string, wait on a
Stop-hook file + the agent's output file, interpret, return. The provider specifics live
behind an **engine** seam (Claude engine now; the seam exists to isolate the dependency, not
because a second engine is imminent).

Source of truth for the design intent: roadmap milestone 10 and `docs/modules/shuttle.md`
(the design doc; deleted when this lands per the documentation lifecycle). For **mux facts,
the code is authoritative, not `docs/modules/mux.md`** — that doc is already drifting and is
deleted in this task.

## Scope

**In:**

- New module: `internal/shuttleengine` (domain kernel) + `internal/shuttlecli` (`lyx shuttle`
  cobra subtree), registered in `cmd/lyx/main.go` per the CLI/Cobra Invariant.
- Engine seam: a Go interface in `shuttleengine`; one implementation,
  `internal/shuttleengine/claudeengine`. Claude only for now.
- One-shot run: `Start(spec)/Wait()` (with a blocking `Run` convenience) — launch via
  `mux.AddStrand`, wait on the Stop-event file + caller-named output files, classify outcome
  (`done | asking | died | timeout`), clean up.
- **In-agent interrupt is in scope (v1):** `Interrupt` (ESC — agent stops, session stays
  warm) + `Send` (one-line follow-up, e.g. updated instructions) — both as Go API and as
  CLI verbs. Rationale: today there is no way to stop an agent, give it updated
  information, and let it continue.
- Claude Code `--settings` composition: Stop hook (writes turn-end payload to a file) +
  PreToolUse guardrails (deny in-process `Agent` and `AskUserQuestion`), guardrails
  config-toggleable.
- New config module `shuttle.yaml` (registered in `internal/configreg`).
- **mux extensions (same task, all provider-agnostic):** `AddSpec.SessionID` (persisted into
  the existing `Strand.SessionID` field), an exported `SendKeys` op (generic key/text
  transport to a strand's pane, needed by Interrupt/Send), and an exported `CapturePane` op
  (needed for startup probing / trust-dialog detection). Remove the unused `claude:` key
  from mux — the `template.yaml` line, the `Config.Claude` struct field
  (`internal/muxengine/config.go:24`), and the empty-default assertion in
  `config_test.go:53-54`.
- Run-artifact lifecycle: per-run directory (prompt file, settings.json, events.jsonl,
  run.json), deleted on clean completion, kept on failure, orphan-swept later.
- Docs: delete `docs/modules/shuttle.md` **and** `docs/modules/mux.md` (documentation
  lifecycle — mux is built and its doc is already stale); fold durable parts into package
  headers + `overview.md`; retarget links in `loom.md`/`review.md`/`roadmap.md`/`overview.md`
  that point at the deleted files; mark roadmap milestone 10 ✅ Done; add shuttle to the
  `overview.md` module table and execution stack; update `CONSTRAINTS.md` pinned CLI test
  sets; sandbox suite coverage for the `shuttle` module.

**Out:**

- Non-Claude engines (Gemini etc.) — the seam exists; no second implementation.
- `review` and `loom` — the callers come later; shuttle ships with the CLI + tests as its
  only consumers.
- Follow-up *turn orchestration* (driving a multi-step conversation) — `Send` exists as a
  primitive for interrupt-with-new-info, but shuttle does not manage multi-turn protocols.
- Respawn-after-death / escalation — caller policy (loom respawns on the file contract;
  escalation is a fresh spawn, never in-session `/model`).
- mux's deferred items stay deferred: `own-window` anchor (cluster reviewers), hidden-strand
  surfacing changes, daemon, `pane-died` auto-trigger, cross-worktree columns.
- The mux "no transcript → fresh launch" resume gap — stays deferred.
- Pause/`pause_requested` machinery — loom's concern; shuttle only provides Interrupt.

## Decisions

### Package layout: engine/cli split with a registered CLI

- Decision: `internal/shuttleengine` + `internal/shuttlecli` (`lyx shuttle`), registered in
  `newRoot()`. Verbs: `run` (blocks until outcome, prints result JSON envelope),
  `interrupt <guid>`, `send <guid> <text>`. Parent group uses `clihelp.GroupRunE`.
- Rationale: standard CONSTRAINTS naming split; a CLI makes shuttle drivable standalone
  (sandbox suite, manual testing, and mill can spawn agents through it before loom exists).
  review/loom later call the Go API directly.
- Rejected: engine-only `internal/shuttle` (no black-box test surface, invisible to the
  sandbox-coverage invariant); CLI as a separate later task.

### Engine seam: interface + claudeengine leaf package

- Decision: a provider interface defined in `shuttleengine`; `internal/shuttleengine/claudeengine`
  implements it. The interface owns everything provider-specific: composing the launch
  command line + `resumeCmd` + session id, writing the settings file (hooks + guardrails),
  interpreting Stop-event payloads (done vs asking), startup babysitting (TUI-appeared probe,
  trust-dialog dismissal), and the key sequences for Interrupt/Send (ESC, Esc-before-text).
  `shuttleengine` owns the provider-invariant machinery: run directory, mux calls, the
  wait/poll loop, outcome classification, cleanup. Import direction:
  `shuttlecli → shuttleengine → claudeengine`-as-plugged-implementation (claudeengine never
  imports shuttlecli).
- Rationale: the verdict/output contract is provider-invariant by design; the interface makes
  the seam visible and gives hermetic tests a fake engine. Claude specifics stay in one leaf.
- Rejected: no interface (concrete Claude type only) — the seam is the design point;
  interface + impl in one package — blurs what is provider-specific.

### Config: new `shuttle.yaml`, flat keys, engine-prefixed; mux loses its dead `claude:` key

- Decision: register a `shuttle` config module in `internal/configreg` with a flat template
  (configengine templates are flat `key: value` with `${env:...}` defaults). Indicative keys
  (plan finalizes names/defaults): `run_dir` (empty ⇒ `<worktree>/.lyx/shuttle/` via
  `hubgeometry.Layout.DotLyxDir()`), `poll_interval_ms` (~500), `liveness_every_n_polls`
  (~10), `run_timeout_min` (default 30), `startup_timeout_s`, and Claude-engine keys
  prefixed `claude_`: `claude` (binary path, empty = PATH), `claude_deny_agent_tool`
  (default true), `claude_deny_ask_user_question` (default true). The unused `claude:` key
  is removed from mux in the same change — `internal/muxengine/template.yaml`, the
  `Config.Claude` struct field (`config.go:24`), and its config-test assertion
  (`config_test.go:53-54`) — with config reconcile handling the schema change (verify
  `lyx config` reconcile behaviour for removed keys).
- Rationale: shuttle owns its provider config; mux stays a dumb carrier. Guardrails are
  config-toggleable per operator request ("modulert"). Engine-specific keys grouped by
  prefix because templates are flat.
- Rationale (geometry note): CONSTRAINTS says geometry is structural/never config-overridable,
  but that governs hub-geometry tokens; a module-local working-dir key is ordinary module
  config (like mux `width`/`height`) as long as the default resolves through hubgeometry.
- Rejected: reusing mux.yaml's `claude:` (wrong ownership); a separate `claude-engine.yaml`
  config module (over-modular for one engine); nested YAML sections (templates are flat).

### mux API additions (generic, dumb-carrier-preserving)

- Decision: three additions to `internal/muxengine`, all provider-agnostic:
  1. `AddSpec.SessionID` — stamped into the existing `Strand.SessionID` field (documented as
     caller-written opaque metadata; today nothing writes it).
  2. Exported `SendKeys(guid, ...)` engine op — literal-text and named-key transport to a
     strand's pane (reusing `sendKeysLiteralArg` hazard handling), under the op lock.
  3. Exported `CapturePane(guid)` engine op — on-demand pane content read (read-only, like
     `Status`: no reconcile, no layout apply).
- Rationale: Interrupt/Send and the startup probe need pane I/O, and psmux access is mux's
  monopoly. All three carry zero domain knowledge — mux still never parses what it transports.
- Rejected: shuttle shelling to `psmux.exe` directly (breaks mux's overlay monopoly and env
  hygiene); shuttle keeping session ids in its own state only (two sources of truth — the
  field already exists on Strand).

### Prompt delivery: always buffered to a run-scoped file

- Decision: `spec.Prompt` is a plain Go string; the Claude engine writes it to
  `<run_dir>/<runID>/prompt.md` and builds the launch line
  `& '<claude>' (Get-Content -Raw '<prompt-file>') --session-id <id> --settings '<settings>'
  [--model <m>] [--dangerously-skip-permissions]`. One code path for all prompts.
- Rationale: mux types the launch command into the pane's pwsh via `send-keys -l` + `Enter`
  (`spawn.go:110-146`) — everything must survive as **one line typed into an interactive
  shell**. Multiline prompts inline would submit on every `\n` (the proven paste hazard);
  quoting arbitrary text is fragile. The file also gives an audit trail and deterministic
  respawn.
- Rejected: single-line-only contract (landmine for callers); dual path (inline when
  single-line) — two code paths, no gain.

### Run directory and cleanup

- Decision: per-run directory `<run_dir>/<runID>/` holding `prompt.md`, `settings.json`,
  `events.jsonl`, `run.json` (run state: strand guid, session id, spec echo — what the CLI
  `interrupt`/`send` verbs and diagnosis need). Files must live **as long as the strand
  lives** (resumeCmd and respawn reference them). Cleanup: on `done` → `RemoveStrand` +
  `os.RemoveAll(runDir)`; on `asking`/`died`/`timeout` → keep strand and directory (operator
  can attach/inspect; it is the diagnosis material). Orphan sweep: a later shuttle run
  removes run dirs whose strand guid no longer exists in `mux.json` — **guarded by an age
  threshold**: a dir younger than the startup window (`startup_timeout_s`, with margin) is
  never swept, because a concurrently starting run creates its dir and `run.json` *before*
  `AddStrand` persists the strand, and an unguarded sweep in that window would delete an
  in-flight run. `.lyx/` is untracked.
- Rejected: never clean (accumulates over long worktree lives); always delete at return
  (loses diagnosis + respawn inputs).

### Stop hook: plain shell append, POSIX paths

- Decision: the Stop hook command is a plain append of stdin to the run's event log —
  `cat >> '<posix-path>/events.jsonl'` (with a newline separator) — no hidden lyx verb.
  Hook commands run under **git-bash on Windows**, so the engine converts the run-dir path
  to POSIX form (`C:\…` → `/c/…`); a backslash path would be silently destroyed.
- Rationale: zero dependencies, daemonless, fits the file contract. shuttle polls and parses
  the JSONL (multiple Stop events accumulate across turns; shuttle tracks its read offset).
- Rejected: hidden `lyx shuttle on-stop` verb (CLI surface + PATH dependency for nothing v1
  needs).

### Outcome classification (the verdict contract)

- Decision: four outcomes. `done` = Stop event received **and** all expected output files
  exist. `asking` = Stop received, output missing — the agent ended its turn asking;
  `LastAssistantMessage` is returned so the caller sees the question. `died` = pane dead (or
  startup probe failed) without a qualifying Stop. `timeout` = deadline passed. Result:
  `{Outcome, SessionID, StrandGUID, LastAssistantMessage, RunDir}`.
- Decision: the **caller** names the expected output files (`spec.OutputFiles []string`) and
  writes its own prompt instructing the agent where to write. shuttle never templates prompt
  content — dumb transport, like mux.
- Decision: **`OutputFiles` is mandatory — at least one path.** `Run` (and `lyx shuttle run`)
  rejects an empty spec with an error. The file hand-off is what makes a run "return" to its
  caller; with zero expected files "all files exist" is vacuously true and every Stop would
  silently classify as `done`, making `asking` unreachable and turning a misconfigured spec
  into silent success. Even tree-mutating agents (future builder workers) end with a small
  report file — the same discipline mill's implementer JSON report uses. A run with no
  result contract belongs one layer down (`lyx mux add`), not in shuttle.
- Rejected: output-file-existence alone (cannot distinguish asking from working — loom needs
  that distinction for human gates); shuttle-side prompt placeholders (prompt opinions belong
  in review/loom profiles); empty-OutputFiles-allowed variants (Stop ⇒ `done` degenerates
  the verdict; Stop ⇒ `asking` makes `done` unreachable instead).

### Waiting: file polling + periodic liveness + deadline

- Decision: poll `events.jsonl` + output files at `poll_interval_ms`; every Nth poll, check
  strand liveness via mux (read-only). Total deadline: `spec.Timeout`, 0 ⇒ config
  `run_timeout_min`. Startup window: within `startup_timeout_s` the engine's probe must see
  the provider TUI in `CapturePane` output (and dismisses the trust dialog if shown); a pane
  whose claude exited immediately (bad flag, not logged in) leaves a live shell that would
  otherwise wait out the full timeout — the startup probe converts that to a fast `died`
  with the captured pane content as diagnostics.
- Rejected: no overall deadline (a hung-but-alive agent blocks a review round forever).

### Guardrails: PreToolUse deny — Agent always, AskUserQuestion mode-coupled

- Decision: settings.json includes `PreToolUse` deny rules, composed per run:
  - **`Agent` deny — always on, in both modes** (config-toggleable via `claude_deny_agent_tool`).
    Steer: do the work in-session / request a visible strand. Invisible nested work is
    equally wrong attended and unattended.
  - **`AskUserQuestion` deny — coupled to `spec.Autonomous`** (config-toggleable via
    `claude_deny_ask_user_question`). `Autonomous: true` (default; unattended): denied,
    because the dialog blocks silently with nobody watching and shuttle cannot even see that
    the agent is asking (no Stop fires). `Autonomous: false` (attended — the caller knows the
    operator will interact, e.g. a discussion phase): **allowed** — in a psmux pane the agent
    is a CLI TUI where AskUserQuestion is a keyboard-navigable picker that works well; the
    operator is attached and answers in place, the turn continues, and shuttle correctly sees
    nothing. (mill's blanket AskUserQuestion ban came from the VS Code extension context; it
    does not transfer to CLI panes.)
  - `spec.Autonomous` also controls `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (on when autonomous).
- Decision: **the deny-steer must preserve escalation.** Steer text (autonomous mode): "You
  cannot open an interactive dialog. If you are blocked or need operator input, state the
  question/blocker as your final message and end your turn WITHOUT writing the result file."
  Never "decide yourself" — that instruction belongs (if at all) to the caller's prompt, not
  shuttle's guardrail. `asking` is thus the **escalation channel**: an agent that is truly
  stuck stops cheaply and the Go caller must handle it; shuttle never auto-answers or
  auto-continues. (Operator incident motivating this: an auto-mode agent that found the
  review machinery broken, was effectively forbidden to ask, and "chose" to ship everything
  unreviewed — the correct behaviour was to halt and escalate "reviewer is broken". What a
  future loom `--auto` does with a blocker-level `asking` — answer vs halt to human — is
  loom's policy design, out of scope here; shuttle guarantees the channel.)
- Rationale: holds the everything-visible-in-mux invariant, prevents silent blocking, and
  keeps the stop-and-ask path always available. The deny-and-steer path is **unprobed**
  (open item in `docs/research/mux-hooks-exploration.md`) — this task must verify it live
  (smoke test).
- Rejected: unconditional AskUserQuestion deny (forces plain-text questions even when the
  operator sits attached and the CLI picker is the better UX); no deny at all (autonomous
  runs can hang invisibly on a dialog).

### Trust dialog: engine-side defensive dismissal

- Decision: during the startup window the Claude engine detects the "trust this folder"
  screen in `CapturePane` output and sends Enter (the proven pattern from
  `TestSmokeClaudeResumeRecallsCodeword`). Defensive robustness: the operator reports not
  seeing it for worktrees in practice (VS Code's workspace-trust prompt is a separate,
  unrelated thing), but claude does show it for genuinely fresh directories (smoke fixtures
  hit it), so the handler stays — cheap, engine-scoped, screen-scraping-as-liveness only
  (never the result channel).
- Rejected: pre-seeding `~/.claude.json` (undocumented schema, brittle); documented
  precondition (kills autonomy for spawned worktrees if it ever does trigger).

### In-agent interrupt: Interrupt + Send pair (API + CLI)

- Decision: `Interrupt(handle|guid)` sends ESC via mux `SendKeys` — the agent stops
  mid-turn, the session stays warm and idle (nothing killed). `Send(handle|guid, text)`
  types a follow-up: Esc first (clears leaked auto-suggest — the empirically required
  sequence), then the text as one literal line, then Enter; the wait loop continues on the
  same `events.jsonl` (next Stop event). `Send` rejects text containing newlines; multiline
  updates ride the file contract (write a file, send the one-line pointer "read <file> —
  updated instructions — and continue"). Go API: `Start(spec) (*Run, error)` returning a
  handle with `Wait/Interrupt/Send`; `Run(spec)` = Start+Wait convenience. CLI:
  `lyx shuttle interrupt <guid>` / `lyx shuttle send <guid> <text>` resolve the run via
  `run.json` (guid ↔ run dir), so an operator can do it from another terminal.
- Decision (v1 limitation, explicit): Interrupt/Send are only meaningful **against a live,
  blocking Run** — the in-process handle, or a still-blocking `lyx shuttle run` poked from
  another terminal (its wait loop keeps reading the same `events.jsonl`, so the next Stop is
  classified normally). Once `Run` has returned (e.g. `asking`), no process re-enters the
  wait loop: a later `send` injects keys but nothing classifies the next outcome. There is
  deliberately **no re-wait path in v1** (`lyx shuttle wait <guid>` is not built); the
  operator handles an already-returned `asking` by attaching (`lyx mux attach`) and typing,
  or the caller starts a fresh run. Revisit when review/loom show a concrete need.
- Rationale (operator): there is no way today to stop an agent with updated information —
  you must interrupt, give new info, and let it continue. Key sequences are Claude-specific
  → engine; transport is generic → mux `SendKeys`.
- Rejected: interrupt-only hold (doesn't cover the use case); Go-API-only (operator locked
  out from other terminals).

### Spec surface (consolidated)

- Decision: the run spec is minimal and closed — no `ExtraArgs` escape hatch; extend the
  struct when a real need arrives. Fields:
  - `Prompt string` (required) — buffered to the run's prompt file by the engine.
  - `OutputFiles []string` (required, ≥1) — the result contract; empty spec is rejected.
  - `Model string` (optional → `--model`).
  - `Autonomous bool` (default true) — controls `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and the
    AskUserQuestion guardrail (see Guardrails decision).
  - `Role, Round string` (optional) — strand-name formatting inputs, passed to `AddSpec`.
  - `Parent string` (optional) — parent strand guid.
  - `Display render.Display` — passed through to mux verbatim.
  - `Timeout time.Duration` (0 ⇒ config `run_timeout_min`).
  - `KeepPane bool` (default false) — when true, `done` skips both `RemoveStrand` and the
    run-dir deletion (debugging aid: inspect the finished session and artifacts). Outcomes
    other than `done` always keep pane + dir regardless.
- Rationale: one visible, documented surface instead of fields scattered across decisions;
  `KeepPane`'s semantics pinned (it modifies only the `done` cleanup path).
- Rejected: `ExtraArgs []string` (launch line becomes an undeclared contract, undermines the
  engine seam).

### Session identity and resume command

- Decision: the engine generates a UUID per run, passes `--session-id <uuid>` at launch,
  hands mux `resumeCmd = & '<claude>' --resume <uuid> --settings '<settings-file>'`, and
  stamps the id into `AddSpec.SessionID`. Deterministic per strand (never `--continue`,
  which grabs the directory's most recent session and misfires with concurrent runs).
- Rejected: `--continue` (ambiguous under concurrency); mux constructing any of this
  (violates the stored-never-constructed resume contract).

### Documentation lifecycle for this landing

- Decision: delete `docs/modules/shuttle.md` and `docs/modules/mux.md`; durable design goes
  in the `shuttleengine`/`claudeengine`/`muxengine` package headers and `overview.md`
  (module table + execution stack). Retarget inbound links (`loom.md`, `review.md`,
  `roadmap.md`, `overview.md`, `CLAUDE.md` if any) to `overview.md#modules` or godoc.
  Roadmap milestone 10 → ✅ Done. The research logs under `docs/research/` stay (they are
  evidence, not module docs).
- Rationale: operator directive — module docs of built modules always rot; mux.md is already
  superseded by code in several places.

## Technical context

- **mux engine API pattern** (what shuttle follows and calls):
  `hubgeometry.Getwd() → hubgeometry.Resolve(cwd) → LoadConfig(layout.Cwd, "<module>") →
  muxengine.New(cfg, layout)` (`internal/muxcli/cli.go:64-91`). All ephemeral state under
  `layout.DotLyxDir()`; never hardcode `.lyx`/`_lyx` (Hub Geometry Invariant).
- **`AddStrand`** (`internal/muxengine/strand.go:305`): takes `AddSpec{Role, Round,
  NameOverride, Parent, Cmd, ResumeCmd, Display}`; engine generates GUID, stamps Worktree,
  launches the pane (adopt-or-split), sends the command via `send-keys -l` + separate
  `Enter` (`spawn.go:110-146`). `Display` uses `render.Display{Anchor, Focus,
  ShrinkWhenWaitingOnChild}`; valid anchors in v1: `top | below-parent | hidden`
  (`own-window` rejected). shuttle passes the caller's Display straight through
  (typical agent: `{anchor: below-parent, focus: true, shrinkWhenWaitingOnChild: true}`).
- **`Strand.SessionID` exists but nothing writes it** (`state.go:25-35` vs `strand.go:24`) —
  the AddSpec extension closes that gap.
- **Send-keys hazards already solved in mux**: `-l` literal mode so `;`/key-names are never
  reinterpreted; leading-`-` text needs the space prefix (`sendKeysLiteralArg`,
  `spawn.go:75-88`). `SendKeys` reuses this.
- **Pane liveness**: `Status()` is read-only (no reconcile, no layout apply) and reports
  live = present ∧ ¬`pane_dead`. `CapturePane` must follow the same read-only discipline.
- **Env hygiene is mux's job and already done**: the psmux server is spawned without
  `CLAUDE_CODE_*` vars (`env.go:CleanClaudeEnv`), so panes launched later inherit a clean
  env; without this, a claude launched from inside a Claude Code session silently stops
  persisting its transcript (breaks `--resume`). shuttle relies on it, adds nothing.
- **Claude launch precedent**: `TestSmokeClaudeResumeRecallsCodeword`
  (`internal/muxcli/smoke_resume_test.go:142`) — pwsh call-operator launch
  (`& '<claude>' '<prompt>'`), trust-dialog dismissal via capture+Enter polling,
  transcript-stability waiting, `deferHubRelease` for the orphaned-conhost teardown hazard.
  The smoke-test helpers there are the starting point for shuttle's smoke layer.
- **Hooks facts** (verified in `docs/research/mux-hooks-exploration.md`): hook commands run
  under git-bash on Windows (POSIX paths only); every payload carries `session_id`,
  `transcript_path`, `cwd`; `Stop` carries `last_assistant_message` + `background_tasks[]`
  and is the immediate idle/needs-input edge; prompts must be injected at launch (paste into
  a live TUI is unreliable); reuse turns are single-line and need Esc first.
- **Claude CLI version note**: hook payloads/flags verified on claude 2.1.177; the engine
  should treat unknown/extra JSON fields leniently (ignore, don't fail).
- **CLI plumbing to reuse**: `internal/clihelp` (Execute/GroupRunE/Abort), `internal/output`
  (Ok/Err JSON envelope), `internal/configengine` + `internal/configreg` (template
  registration), `internal/lyxtest` (SeedConfig, paired fixtures — leaf invariant: shuttle
  tests seed config via `lyxtest.SeedConfig` with `shuttleengine.ConfigTemplate()` at the
  call site).
- **Registration ripples**: `cmd/lyx/main.go` `newRoot()` (+ root `Long` module list),
  pinned sets in `drift_test.go`/`helptree_test.go`/`registration_test.go`/
  `longlist_test.go`, sandbox coverage guard (`sandbox_coverage_test.go`).

## Constraints

From `CONSTRAINTS.md` (all apply; the file must be read before implementing/reviewing):

- **Hub Geometry Invariant** — all cwd/geometry via `hubgeometry`; no geometry tokens in
  path construction; config paths via `ConfigDir`/`ConfigFile` (in tests too). shuttle's
  run dir resolves through `layout.DotLyxDir()` when `run_dir` is unset.
- **lyxtest Leaf Invariant** — lyxtest imports nothing from shuttle; tests seed shuttle
  config at the test site.
- **CLI / Cobra Invariant** — `Command()`/`RunCLI` seam, `Short` on every command, JSON
  envelope for results/errors (no envelope exception needed: `run` blocks but prints JSON at
  the end — it is not a terminal handover), `GroupRunE` on the parent, registration + pinned
  help-tree test updates in the same commit. Package naming `shuttlecli`/`shuttleengine`.
- **Sandbox Suite Coverage** — a scenario tagged `**Covers:** shuttle` in a
  `tools/sandbox/*SUITE.md` file (new `SANDBOX-SHUTTLE-SUITE.md` or a section in the mux
  suite — plan decides), or an explicit allowlist entry. A scenario consumes a real
  subscription claude session; that is accepted (the mux suite already does).
- **Documentation Lifecycle** — design docs deleted on landing (see the decision above);
  module doc/overview/roadmap updates in the same commit as the behaviour.
- New cross-cutting invariants discovered during implementation go into `CONSTRAINTS.md` in
  the same commit (candidate: "provider specifics live only under `claudeengine`; shuttle
  core and mux stay provider-invariant" — plan/implementation judges whether to enshrine).

## Testing

Three layers plus process hardening:

1. **Hermetic unit tests** (run on every `go test`):
   - claudeengine pure functions: launch/resume command composition (quoting, model flag,
     autonomous flag, session id), settings.json content (Stop hook wiring, guardrail
     toggles on/off from config), Windows→POSIX path conversion for hook commands,
     Stop-payload interpretation (done/asking off `last_assistant_message` + output
     presence), trust-screen and TUI-appeared detection off captured text fixtures.
   - shuttleengine run loop against a **fake mux seam** (small interface over
     AddStrand/RemoveStrand/Status/SendKeys/CapturePane) and a fake engine: outcome
     classification for all four outcomes, event-offset tracking across multiple Stop
     events, startup-probe failure ⇒ fast `died`, timeout ⇒ strand kept, cleanup on `done`,
     orphan sweep, Interrupt/Send sequencing, Send newline rejection.
   - mux additions: AddSpec.SessionID persisted round-trip; SendKeys literal-arg hazard;
     CapturePane read-only discipline (no reconcile/apply) — following existing muxengine
     test patterns.
   - CLI: help-tree/registration/drift/longlist pinned-set updates; envelope-shaped errors.
   - TDD candidates: outcome classification, command composition, settings composition,
     POSIX conversion, event-log offset parsing.
2. **Opt-in smoke tests** (`-tags smoke`, real claude, subscription-consuming; muxcli smoke
   patterns incl. `deferHubRelease`): (a) one full `Run` end-to-end — prompt in, Stop hook
   fires, output file written, outcome `done`, run dir cleaned; (b) guardrail verification —
   agent instructed to use the `Agent` tool, deny fires, run still completes (this closes
   the unprobed deny-and-steer item); (c) Interrupt+Send — interrupt a running agent, send
   updated one-line instruction, agent continues and completes.
3. **Sandbox suite scenario(s)** driving `lyx shuttle run` (and interrupt/send) black-box,
   tagged `**Covers:** shuttle`.

Process: before merge, harden via the hand-executed review loop documented in
`docs/reviews/` (A-review → B-fix, fresh reviewer per round, no self-grading) — the method
that hardened mux over seven rounds. The operator explicitly wants this rigor repeated;
psmux/claude behavioural uncertainty is exactly where it pays.

## Q&A log

- **Q:** CLI or engine-only? **A:** Engine/cli split with registered `lyx shuttle` — standalone drivability and sandbox coverage; mill can use it before loom exists.
- **Q:** Engine seam shape? **A:** Interface in shuttleengine + `claudeengine` sub-package; Claude only for now.
- **Q:** Config ownership? **A:** New `shuttle.yaml` config module; remove mux's unused `claude:` key in the same task; engine keys `claude_*`-prefixed (flat templates).
- **Q:** Where does the Claude session id live? **A:** Extend `muxengine.AddSpec` with `SessionID`; the Strand field already exists as caller-written metadata.
- **Q:** Must prompts be buffered to a file? **A:** Yes — the launch line is typed into an interactive pwsh via send-keys, so multiline/quoted prompts cannot ride inline; shuttle always writes `prompt.md` and uses `(Get-Content -Raw …)`. Operator accepted after the send-keys mechanics were explained.
- **Q:** Won't run files pile up? **A:** Run-scoped dirs; delete on clean completion, keep on failure for diagnosis, sweep orphans later. Files must outlive launch (resume/respawn reference them). Run-dir *location* is a config key (`run_dir`), default under `.lyx/` via hubgeometry.
- **Q:** Stop-hook transport? **A:** Plain `cat >>` append to `events.jsonl` with POSIX path; no hidden lyx verb.
- **Q:** Completion semantics? **A:** Four outcomes (`done`/`asking`/`died`/`timeout`); Stop event + output-file existence; `asking` carries `last_assistant_message`.
- **Q:** Who names output files? **A:** The caller (spec + its own prompt text); shuttle never templates prompts.
- **Q:** Strand at run end? **A:** Remove + clean on `done`; keep on `asking`/`died`/`timeout`; `KeepPane` override.
- **Q:** What are guardrails? **A:** PreToolUse denies on `Agent` (nested work must stay visible) and `AskUserQuestion` (never block on a hidden dialog → surfaces as `asking`). Operator: implement, but config-toggleable ("modulert"), and Claude gets its own tailored config keys.
- **Q:** Trust dialog — real problem? **A:** Operator has not seen it for worktrees (VS Code workspace-trust is a separate mechanism); smoke fixtures do hit claude's own dialog. Keep the cheap engine-side dismissal as defensive robustness ("gjør det du må").
- **Q:** In-agent interrupt in v1? **A:** Yes — operator's core need: stop an agent, give it updated info, let it continue. `Interrupt` + `Send` pair, Go API + CLI verbs; multiline updates via file + one-line pointer.
- **Q:** Testing rigor? **A:** Three layers (hermetic / smoke / sandbox) plus the `docs/reviews/` hand-executed review loop before merge, as with mux.
- **Q:** mux.md authority? **A:** Operator: module docs of built modules always rot — use the mux *code* as the source of truth; delete `docs/modules/mux.md` in this task.
- **Q:** (review r1 gap) Empty `OutputFiles`? **A:** Mandatory, ≥1 — a run without a result file has no defined "done"; reject empty spec loudly. Operator convinced by "the file hand-off is what makes the run return"; no-result runs belong in `lyx mux add`.
- **Q:** (review r1 notes) Orphan-sweep race and send-after-return? **A:** Sweep gets an age guard (never touch dirs younger than the startup window); Interrupt/Send documented as live-run-only, no re-wait path in v1.
- **Q:** (review r2 gap) AskUserQuestion steer contradicted `asking` (write-to-output-file would classify as `done`)? **A:** Resolved two ways: the deny is now **mode-coupled** — allowed when `Autonomous: false` (operator attached; CLI picker works well; the old mill ban was a VS Code-extension artifact), denied when autonomous; and the autonomous steer is "ask as your final message, end the turn WITHOUT writing the result file" ⇒ `asking` with the question in `LastAssistantMessage`.
- **Q:** What about an agent that is HARD stuck in auto mode and must escalate? **A:** `asking` IS the escalation channel and must never be closed: the steer never says "decide yourself" (operator incident: an auto agent forbidden to ask found the review machinery broken and shipped everything unreviewed instead of halting). Caller-side auto-policy for blocker-level asks is loom's later design; shuttle guarantees the stop-and-ask path.
- **Q:** (review r2 notes) mux `claude:` removal ripple; `KeepPane` ambiguity? **A:** Removal includes `Config.Claude` field + config-test assertion; spec surface consolidated into its own decision with `KeepPane` semantics pinned (modifies only the `done` cleanup path).
