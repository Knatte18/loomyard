## Task

Read the discussion at `C:\Code\loomyard\wts\internal-shuttle\_mill\discussion.md`. The discussion file is the authoritative scope. Read files referenced in `## Technical Context` to verify claims.

Constraints:
# Constraints

Short, authoritative list of the repo's structural invariants. Each is partly
machine-enforced (named test, fails `go test` / CI) and partly a review obligation.
Fuller design/how-to lives in godoc and `docs/`, not here — this file is the index.

## Hub Geometry Invariant

`internal/hubgeometry` owns all cwd, worktree-root, and geometry resolution.

- All cwd / worktree-root queries go through `hubgeometry.Getwd()` / `Resolve()`. Raw
  `os.Getwd` and `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` are banned outside `internal/hubgeometry`
  and `cmd/lyx/main.go`.
- Geometry tokens — `_board`, `-weft`, `-HUB`, `_portals`, `_launchers`, `_codeguide`,
  `_lyx` — are owned solely by `internal/hubgeometry`. No other package may use them in a
  path-construction context (a `filepath.Join` arg, a `+` operand, or a string `const`).
  Whole-token match; production files only; comparisons and git-pathspec slice literals
  are not path construction and stay allowed.
- `_lyx`, its `config/` subdir, and any `<module>.yaml` resolve through
  `hubgeometry.LyxDirName` / `ConfigDir(base)` / `ConfigFile(base, module)` — **in test
  code too** (a config-layout migration once broke a hardcoded test fixture).
- Geometry is structural, never config/env-overridable (the board dir is `--board-path`
  flag > `hubgeometry.BoardDir(l.Hub)`, not a config key).
- **Enforced by** `internal/hubgeometry/enforcement_test.go` (`TestEnforcement_GeometryLiterals`)
  on every `go test`. API and helpers: godoc for `internal/hubgeometry`.

## lyxtest Leaf Invariant

`internal/lyxtest` stays a leaf: it imports only the standard library and
`internal/hubgeometry` — never `internal/configreg` or any feature package
(`boardengine`/`boardcli`, `warpengine`/`warpcli`, `weftengine`/`weftcli`, …).

- A `lyxtest → configreg → feature` edge closes a test-build cycle under
  `-tags integration`. Tests needing real config call `lyxtest.SeedConfig(tb, dir,
  map[string]string{...})`; the `configreg`→map conversion happens at the test site, in a
  package that may legally import `configreg`.
- **Enforced by** `internal/lyxtest/leaf_enforcement_test.go` on every `go test`.

## CLI / Cobra Invariant

Every lyx CLI module is a cobra subtree assembled under one root in `cmd/lyx/main.go`.

- **Seam.** Each module exposes `Command() *cobra.Command` and a thin
  `RunCLI(out io.Writer, args []string) int` = `clihelp.Execute(Command(), out, args)`.
  Tests and root both drive the module through this seam.
- **Registration.** A new module is wired into `newRoot()`: import, `root.AddCommand(...)`,
  and append the module name to the root `Long` module-list. Unregistered ⇒ invisible to
  `--help`.
- **`Short` on every command** (parent + sub), non-empty. Self-discoverable commands also
  carry a `Long` with concrete examples.
- **Help accuracy is a review obligation.** Presence of `Short` is machine-checked;
  prose-vs-behaviour is not. When a change alters observable behaviour, the reviewer must
  re-read every affected `Short`/`Long` and confirm it matches the code as changed — stale
  help is a review-blocking defect. Prefer generating mechanical help facts from source
  (e.g. configcli's `Known modules:` from `configreg.Names()`).
- **Errors are JSON.** Results and errors go through the `internal/output` envelope
  (`output.Ok` / `output.Err`), one JSON object per line, via the `clihelp.Execute` /
  root seam (`SilenceErrors = true`). No bare plain-text error paths. Parent groups set
  `RunE = clihelp.GroupRunE` to reject unknown subcommands.
- **Interactive-handoff exception (narrow, per-command).** A subcommand whose whole job is
  to hand the operator's stdio to another interactive program and block (`ide menu`'s stdin
  picker; `mux attach`'s `psmux attach`) cannot emit the JSON envelope on that terminal-handover
  tail. The exception is scoped tightly: everything that can fail runs **pre-flight and stays
  on the envelope** (`output.Err`, non-zero exit); only the post-handoff tail is exempt, and on
  success it emits no JSON. `mux attach` follows the pre-existing `ide menu` precedent; see
  [docs/modules/mux.md](docs/modules/mux.md#attach-is-a-documented-envelope-exception) for the
  full rationale.
- **Package naming.** A Cobra-registered package is `<module>cli`; its extracted domain
  kernel is `<module>engine`. cli imports engine; engine never imports cli or cobra.
  Litmus: returns `(T, error)` with no cobra/`io.Writer`/exit codes ⇒ engine. Skip the
  engine only for trivial wrappers (`configcli`) or throwaway (`muxpoccli`);
  "no consumer today" is not a skip reason. `initcli`/`initengine` follows the standard
  split (no longer exempt — `lyx init --undo` grew enough core logic that mixing it into
  the cli package was rot, not simplicity).
- **Enforced by** `cmd/lyx/drift_test.go` (every command has `Short`),
  `helptree_test.go` (root names every module, module names every subcommand),
  `registration_test.go` (exists ⇒ registered), `longlist_test.go` (registered ⇒ in
  `root.Long`). Update the pinned sets in the same commit when adding a module/subcommand.

## Sandbox Suite Coverage

Every registered lyx module must be exercised by the black-box sandbox suite or be
explicitly excluded with a reason.

- **Tagging.** A scenario in **any** suite file matching
  `tools/sandbox/*SUITE.md` (today: `SANDBOX-CORE-SUITE.md`,
  `SANDBOX-MUX-SUITE.md`) that drives a specific module declares it with a
  `**Covers:** <module>[, <module>...]` line, in the same bold-label style as the
  scenario's `**Goal:**`/`**Watch:**`/`**Verdict:**` lines. The guard unions tags
  across all matched files. Coverage is checked at module granularity against the
  live cobra root (`newRoot().Commands()`, skipping `help`/`completion`) — the same
  enumeration `longlist_test.go` already uses, never a separately hand-maintained
  list. The guard fails fast if the glob matches fewer than two files (vacuous-glob
  protection).
- **Allowlist.** Modules that are intentionally never sandbox-exercised across any
  suite file are named on the test's `excludedModules` allowlist with a one-line
  reason: `ide` (side-effect heavy: `spawn` opens a real VS Code window, `menu` is
  an interactive stdin picker), `selfreport` (`create` files a real GitHub issue).
- **Exists ⇒ covered or excluded.** Adding a new registered module requires either
  a scenario in some suite file tagged with that module's `**Covers:**` or a new
  allowlist entry with a reason — the same "exists ⇒ registered" discipline as the
  CLI/Cobra Invariant's registration guard.
- **Enforced by** `cmd/lyx/sandbox_coverage_test.go`
  (`TestSandboxCoverage_AllModulesCoveredOrExcluded`) on every `go test`.

## Documentation Lifecycle

Which docs are kept vs deleted (mechanical per-module docs vs durable design docs):
see [docs/overview.md#documentation-lifecycle](docs/overview.md#documentation-lifecycle).


## Source-grounding rule

Never fabricate file contents or code behaviour you have not actually read. You are in tool-use mode — if you need a file to verify a claim in the discussion, open it with Read/Grep/Glob. Do not infer from filenames or positions.

## Criteria (apply briefly to each)

- **Undecided items** — TBDs, unresolved options, multiple alternatives without a choice.
- **Scope** — what's in/out; could a plan writer disagree?
- **Constraint coverage** — CONSTRAINTS.md items acknowledged; implicit perf/compat constraints stated.
- **Failure modes** — empty states, concurrency, invalid input, partial failures addressed.
- **Testing** — strategy named (unit/integration/e2e); absence or non-commital language flagged.
- **Ambiguity** — requirements needing interpretation ("fast", "handle errors").
- **Feasibility** — technical obstacles not addressed, based on source files read.
- **Decisions** — each `### Decision:` has rationale + rejected alternatives; implicit decisions surfaced.

## Output format — STRICT

Wrap your entire output in `MILL_REVIEW_BEGIN` / `MILL_REVIEW_END` markers, each on its own line. Everything outside these markers is ignored by the backend. **No preamble inside the markers.** No "I reviewed..." sentences. No narrative intro.

Per finding: 3–5 lines total, short and factual. The consumer has full context of the discussion; do NOT explain background. Cite the section, state what's wrong, propose the fix.

Target length: ~300 tokens for APPROVE (just verdict + brief summary), ~600–900 tokens for GAPS_FOUND (one finding block per issue). If you produce more than ~1200 tokens, you are being verbose — compress.

```
MILL_REVIEW_BEGIN
# Review: Build internal/shuttle: one LLM agent via a swappable engine

```yaml
verdict: APPROVE | GAPS_FOUND
reviewer_model: opushigh
reviewed_file: <artefact reference>
date: <UTC YYYY-MM-DD>
```

## Findings

### [GAP] <short title, <60 chars>
**Section:** <§ or heading>
**Issue:** <one sentence — what's missing or ambiguous>
**Fix:** <one sentence — what to clarify or add>

### [NOTE] <short title>
**Section:** <§>
**Issue:** <one sentence>
**Fix:** <one sentence>

## Verdict

<APPROVE | GAPS_FOUND>
<one sentence — max 20 words>
MILL_REVIEW_END
```

Severity rules (discussion-specific, per v1 convention):
- `GAP` — must resolve before plan writing can proceed.
- `NOTE` — record but do not block.

Verdict rules:
- `APPROVE` — zero GAPs. NOTEs fine.
- `GAPS_FOUND` — one or more GAPs.

Note: plan and code reviews use `BLOCKING` / `NIT` + `REQUEST_CHANGES`. Discussion review uses `GAP` / `NOTE` + `GAPS_FOUND` because the semantics differ — a discussion "gap" is missing information, not a must-fix defect.

Omit the `## Findings` section entirely if there are zero findings. Never invent findings to pad the review.
