# Constraints

## Path Invariant

All worktree and hub geometry must be resolved through `internal/paths`, not raw primitives. This invariant is enforced at build time.

### Rule

- All cwd and worktree root queries MUST go through `internal/paths.Getwd()` and `internal/paths.Resolve()`.
- Raw `os.Getwd` is forbidden outside `internal/paths` and `cmd/lyx/main.go`.
- Raw `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` is forbidden outside `internal/paths` and `cmd/lyx/main.go`.
- The ban is enforced at `go test` / CI time by `internal/paths/enforcement_test.go`, which scans the entire source tree and fails the build if either primitive is found.

### `_lyx` and config-file paths

- The `_lyx` directory name, its `config/` subdirectory, and any `<module>.yaml` config file MUST be resolved through `internal/paths` helpers — never built from string literals like `filepath.Join(base, "_lyx", "config")` or `"board.yaml"`.
  - `paths.LyxDirName` — the `_lyx` directory name constant (use `filepath.Join(base, paths.LyxDirName)` for a bare `_lyx` dir).
  - `paths.ConfigDir(base)` — the `<base>/_lyx/config` directory.
  - `paths.ConfigFile(base, module)` — the `<base>/_lyx/config/<module>.yaml` file (e.g. `module` = `"board"`, `"worktree"`, `"weft"`). For a relative path, pass `"."` as `base`.
- **This rule applies to test code too.** A migration of the config layout (PR #20 moved configs from `_lyx/<module>.yaml` to `_lyx/config/<module>.yaml`) silently broke a hardcoded test fixture (`internal/worktree/cli_test.go`) because its literal write path drifted from the loader's read path. Routing every path through the helpers makes such migrations track automatically. The two genuine exceptions are `internal/paths/*_test.go` (those literals *are* the spec under test) and `_lyx` used as link-target geometry or string-content assertions — neither resolves a config path.
- This case is **not** caught by `internal/paths/enforcement_test.go` (which only bans `os.Getwd` / `git rev-parse`); it is a code-review and planning-discipline rule.

### For New Code

If you need a cwd or worktree root:
- Call `paths.Getwd()` to get the current working directory.
- Call `paths.Resolve(cwd)` to obtain a `Layout` with all geometry fields (root, hub, relative path, etc.).
- Use the `Layout` methods to derive paths: `LyxDir()`, `WorktreePath(slug)`, `PortalsDir()`, `PortalLink(slug)`, `PortalTarget(slug)`, `LaunchersDir()`, `LauncherDir(slug)`, `MenuLauncherPath()`, `LauncherSpawnRel(slug)`, `MenuLauncherRel()`, `PrimeName()`, `WeftRepoRoot()`, `WeftWorktreePath(slug)`, `WeftWorktree()`, `WeftLyxDir()`, `WeftLyxDirFor(slug)`, `WeftCodeguideDir()`, `HostLyxLink(slug)`, `HostLyxLinkHere()`, `HostJunctions(slug)`.

If you need an `_lyx` / config path (in production or test code), use `paths.LyxDirName`, `paths.ConfigDir(base)`, and `paths.ConfigFile(base, module)` as above.

## lyxtest Leaf Invariant

`internal/lyxtest` must remain a leaf package importing only the standard library and `internal/paths`. It must not import `internal/configreg` or any feature package (`board`, `worktree`, `weft`).

### Rule

- `internal/lyxtest` must not import `internal/configreg` or any feature package.
- Tests that need real configuration must seed it themselves via `SeedConfig`, passing a configreg-free `map[string]string` (module name to YAML content).
- The `configreg.Modules()` to map conversion happens at the test site, in a package that may legally import `configreg`.
- Feature packages' internal tests import `lyxtest`; a `lyxtest → configreg → feature` import would close a test-build cycle (the trap that motivated this task).

### Rationale

The cycle closes silently when `lyxtest` imports `configreg` and `configreg` imports feature packages, but only under `-tags integration` (feature-internal tests are integration-tagged). An untagged import-scan test (`internal/lyxtest/leaf_enforcement_test.go`) catches a reintroduced edge on every `go test ./...` with a clear message, instead of waiting for an integration suite run.

### For New Tests

If a test needs real config:
- Obtain each module's template from the module's own `ConfigTemplate()` function (e.g., `weft.ConfigTemplate()`).
- Use the unqualified name (`ConfigTemplate()`) when calling from a file in that same package.
- Use the qualified form (e.g., `weft.ConfigTemplate()`) from a different package, adding the feature import as needed to the test file.
- Pass the templates to `lyxtest.SeedConfig(tb, repoDir, map[string]string{...})` **never** pass `configreg.Module` types or call `configreg` from inside lyxtest.

The enforcement test (`internal/lyxtest/leaf_enforcement_test.go`) is run on every `go test ./...` and fails the build if any of the banned imports appear in lyxtest source files.
