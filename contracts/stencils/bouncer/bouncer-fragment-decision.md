<!-- This is the decision detail of the Bouncer's escalation brief for cause `decision`: the questions the review cannot settle itself, the BLOCKING findings the round's review holds, the refusal the recorded answer would meet, and the verbs that record it.
     renderDecisionDetail fills it and passes the result as the brief's cause_detail marker, after the cause list.
     Every marker below is a top-level {{.X}} substitution: slug, decision_findings, blocking_findings, refusal and decide_verbs, each Go-filled and non-empty. -->

### Decision findings

Each finding below is a question the review could not settle itself.
Where an arbiter runs, it settles each finding the board entry and the decision record answer before the parent sees it.
Put each remaining finding to the operator, unless a recorded operator decision answers it.

{{.decision_findings}}

### BLOCKING findings of the round's review

{{.blocking_findings}}

### Refusal

{{.refusal}}

When a refusal is named, the round is re-judged before the recorded answer acts while budget is left.
An `accept` passes the round over every BLOCKING finding listed once a judgment is admitted, and at or past the hard cap halts the run if the refusal still holds at the budget.
A `continue` runs another round whose fresh reviewers re-review the artifact, so a listed BLOCKING finding reaches that round's fixer only if they raise it again.

### Way forward

Record the answer with `lym loom decision add {{.slug}}`, then record the segment's outcome with exactly one of:

{{.decide_verbs}}

Then resume the run with `lym loom resume`.
